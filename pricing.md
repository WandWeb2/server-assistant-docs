# 💸 Pricing

**Core moderation is free forever.** AI features cost real money to run, so they're metered — subscribe when you want them, and billing only starts once you've used your free tokens.

<style>
.price-intro { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1.6fr; gap: 1rem; align-items: stretch; margin: 1.25rem 0; }
.price-intro .pi-card { background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5); border: 1px solid rgba(31,38,135,0.12); border-left: 4px solid #3498db; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1rem 1.2rem; }
.price-intro .pi-card p { margin: 0; font-size: .92rem; line-height: 1.5; }
@media (max-width: 640px) { .price-intro { grid-template-columns: 1fr; } }
</style>

<div class="price-intro">

    <p>💳 <strong>All prices in USD.</strong> Tax is added at checkout based on your billing region — Stripe and Discord handle it automatically.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pi-card">
    <p>🩺 <strong>Why Server Assistant?</strong> The free tier alone gives you four things almost no other mod bot does — daily health insight (Pulse), fair one-reply ban appeals, an encrypted tamper-proof audit trail, and repeat-offender / ban-evasion detection. AI features build on top of that, not in place of it. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/">See the differentiators →</a></p>

## What's always free

These never count against any token allowance:

<style>
.free-cols { columns: 2; column-gap: 2rem; margin: .8rem 0; }
.free-cols ul { margin: 0; padding-left: 1.1rem; }
.free-cols li { break-inside: avoid; margin-bottom: .45rem; font-size: .92rem; line-height: 1.45; }
@media (max-width: 640px) { .free-cols { columns: 1; } }
</style>

<div class="free-cols" markdown="1">

- **Slash + text commands** — `/warn`, `/mute`, `/kick`, `/ban`, `/purge`, and all moderation tools
- **Baseline admin essentials** — `/role add` / `/role remove`, `/tempban` (timed bans, persists across restarts), `/lockdown start` / `/lockdown end` (server-wide channel lock with exact-prior-perm restore)
- **AutoMod** — filter packs, custom regex, punishment ladder, link blocklist, anti-spam
- **Anti-raid** — mass-join detection, alerts, auto-suspend
- **DM Verification Gate** — button-based new-member verification
- **🕵️ Repeat-offender / alt-guard detection** (`/altguard`) — fingerprints banned & kicked users, auto-bans confident ban-evading matches on join
- **📩 Ban reasons + one-reply appeals** — every ban DMs the user *why*; one reply opens a staff appeal ticket with Unban / Deny / Research buttons (the DM and reply use no AI tokens; **Research** invokes the metered Message Report only if you ask)
- **Warning + notes system** — full per-guild history
- **🛡️ Encrypted tamper-proof audit log** — native-action logging, tamper alerts, owner ping if anyone deletes an entry
- **24-hour undo** — bans, mutes, channel deletions, nickname changes
- **`/setup` and `/settings`** — 60-second onboarding + 9-panel Customisation Hub
- **Auto-pilot bootstrap** — zero-touch setup via `/autopilot`
- **Privacy panel** — `/privacy` to control exactly what the bot reads
- **Snippets + scheduled reminders**
- **`/imagine`** AI image generation — the free trial covers ~30 images (30s/guild cooldown); **unlimited on Premium** (no cooldown), or bring your own image key
- **Ticket Panels (core)** — panel embed, private ticket channels, one intake question, `.txt` transcripts on close, `/tickets close`

> **A note on Threat Score:** the **advisory** view (a per-user risk pill in profiles) is free for every server — it's just visibility. The Premium **active** version is what uses the score to drive actions, with all the safeguards documented on the [Roadmap]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/).

**Ticket Panels — premium features** include: up to 4 custom intake form questions, custom welcome and close messages, and `/tickets add @user` to grant mid-ticket access.

### How Premium trial billing works

Subscribe to Premium ($7/mo) and your card is saved but **not charged today**. You get **150,000 free tokens** first — the same as the free trial — and billing starts the moment they run out. Small or light-use servers may never deplete 150K tokens, so they never pay a cent despite being subscribed.

**BYOK** = Bring Your Own Key. Paste your Anthropic, xAI, or OpenAI key via `/ai-config` — you pay your provider directly for token usage, and pay us just $3/mo for the software and infrastructure.

## Top-up packs

Need extra headroom without changing plans? Three sizes — **Splash** for a light overflow, **Surge** for a busy month, **Stockpile** for heavy use. Top-ups never expire and stack on any tier.

| Pack            | Price       | Tokens      | $ per 100K |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 🪣 **Splash**     | $3 USD      | 300K        | $1.00      |
| 🛢️ **Surge**      | $10 USD     | 1.25M       | $0.80      |
| 🏭 **Stockpile**  | $25 USD     | 3.4M        | $0.74      |

> 💡 **Using AI most months?** Premium ($7/mo for 750K monthly tokens) is the cheapest steady-state rate. Top-ups are designed for **bursts and overflow** — Surge and Stockpile give better per-token value because you're paying upfront with no subscription.

## 🎁 Founding servers

Servers that joined during the beta are grandfathered with **12 months of free Premium**, applied automatically — our thanks for being early. This window has closed for new servers, but the generous free tier and 150K trial above are open to everyone.

---

## Payment

- **Stripe** — credit/debit card, available now
- **Discord App Subscriptions** — pay directly through Discord *(available when Server Assistant reaches 75 server installs)*

Premium is per-server. Cancel anytime — no charge if you cancel before your 150K trial runs out.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Will I be charged when I subscribe to Premium?</summary>
Not immediately. We capture your card at signup but only charge it once your 150K free tokens are fully used. If your server never hits that limit, you're never billed.
</details>

<details><summary>What happens when I run out of free tokens?</summary>
<p>AI features pause. <strong>Everything that doesn't use AI keeps working with no change</strong> — AutoMod, anti-raid, warnings, slash commands, the encrypted audit log, Ticket Panels, <code>/lockdown</code>, <code>/tempban</code>, alt-guard, and ban-reason DMs + the one-reply appeal flow (the DM and the appeal ticket don't consume AI tokens; only the <strong>Research</strong> button on an appeal does, and you only spend if you press it). You'll get a DM — if you're subscribed to Premium, billing starts automatically. If you're on the free tier, you can subscribe or buy a top-up to continue.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What if a single user spams Concierge or Message Report?</summary>
Each high-variance feature has an invisible 6-hour rolling cap per user — generous enough that normal use never hits it, tight enough to stop abuse from draining your allowance.
</details>

<details><summary>Can I bring my own AI key?</summary>
Yes — `/ai-config` lets you paste your own Anthropic, xAI, or OpenAI key. BYOK calls don't count against any allowance. Premium BYOK ($3/mo) gives you all Premium features while you supply the tokens.
</details>

<details><summary>What if I cancel Premium?</summary>
You drop to the free tier. If your 150K lifetime trial was already used, AI features pause until you re-subscribe or buy a top-up. Core moderation and basic Ticket Panels never stop.
</details>

<details><summary>Do prices include tax?</summary>
No — applicable VAT, GST, or sales tax is added at checkout based on your billing region. Stripe and Discord calculate and collect it automatically.
</details>
