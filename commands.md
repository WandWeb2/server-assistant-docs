# 📚 Commands Reference

Server Assistant supports **three interaction modes**. Most commands are available in all three:

1. **Slash commands — anywhere.** Every moderation action (`/warn`, `/mute`, `/kick`, `/ban`, `/purge`, …) works as a slash command in **any channel**, so you never have to switch to staff-chat to act.
2. **Text commands — in staff-chat** (`warn @user`, `purge 50`). A convenience for working inside your staff channel; not available in other channels.
3. **Right-click context menus** on users and messages.

> Commands are role-gated, and some actions may require approval from a higher tier — see **[Permissions & approval](#-permissions--approval)** below. Run `/help` to see what's available to you specifically.

## 🛡️ Moderation

Targeting users supports `@mention`, plain-text username (e.g. `mute jen`), or numeric Discord user ID.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `ban @user [reason]` | Ban a user | `ban @spammer raid` |
| `kick @user [reason]` | Kick a user | `kick username spam` |
| `softban @user` | Ban + immediate unban — clears recent messages, lets user rejoin | `softban @user` |
| `mute @user 30 min` | Timeout a user. Supports `min` / `hour` units | `mute @user 2 hr` |
| `unmute @user` | Remove a user's timeout | `unmute @user` |
| `warn @user reason` | Issue a tracked warning. DMs the user. | `warn @user posting NSFW` |
| `warnings @user` | View a user's warning history | `warnings @user` |
| `unwarn @user [id]` | Remove a warning. Without ID, removes the latest | `unwarn @user 3` |
| `nick @user new-name` | Change a user's nickname | `nick @user Helper` |
| `nick reset @user` | Reset a user's nickname | `nick reset @user` |

**Bulk operations:** mention a role to apply the action to everyone in it. Examples: `mute @TrollRole 1 hour`, `ban @SpamRole`. Mod-tier maxes at 5 users; Admin/Owner have higher limits.

## ↩️ Undo (24h window)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `undo` | Reverse your last reversible action (within 24h) |

> ⚠️ Channel undo recreates the channel with original name, topic, NSFW, slowmode, category, and all permission overwrites — but **messages and threads cannot be recovered**. Discord doesn't preserve them.

## 🔑 Permissions & approval

Each role you configure in `/settings → Role Tiers` has **capabilities** (what actions it can use), a **level** (its rank), and **approval authority** (whether it can run *dangerous* actions directly). Defaults out of the box:

| | 🟢 Moderator | 🟠 Admin | 🔴 Owner |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Level** | 25 | 50 | 100 |
| **Approval authority** | — | — | ✅ |

### What each tier can run (defaults)

You can customise any of this in `/settings → Role Tiers` — grant Mods `/unban`, take `/ban` away, give an Admin role approval authority, or create new tiers entirely.

### How approval routes

<style>
.flow { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 0.5rem; align-items: stretch; margin: 1rem 0; }
.flow-step { flex: 1 1 200px; min-width: 180px; padding: 0.75rem 1rem; border-radius: 12px; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6); border: 1px solid rgba(31,38,135,0.15); box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(31,38,135,0.07); font-size: 0.92rem; }
.flow-step.act { background: rgba(37,99,235,0.10); border-color: rgba(37,99,235,0.3); }
.flow-step.approve { background: rgba(241,196,15,0.12); border-color: rgba(201,122,23,0.35); }
.flow-step.ok { background: rgba(46,204,113,0.12); border-color: rgba(27,142,58,0.35); }
.flow-arrow { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: 1.4rem; color: #6a7280; min-width: 1.6rem; }
@media (max-width: 700px) { .flow { flex-direction: column; } .flow-arrow { transform: rotate(90deg); } }
</style>

<div class="flow">
  <div class="flow-step act">Mod runs <code>/purge</code> in any channel</div>
  <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="flow-step">Mod lacks <code>purge</code> capability → <strong>denied</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="flow">
  <div class="flow-step act">Admin runs <code>/purge</code></div>
  <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="flow-step approve">Approval request posted to staff-chat (✅ / ❌)</div>
  <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="flow-step">Only the <strong>Owner</strong> (a tier above) can approve</div>
  <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="flow-step ok">Executes + audit-logged</div>
</div>
<div class="flow">
  <div class="flow-step act">Owner runs <code>/purge</code></div>
  <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="flow-step ok">Executes immediately + audit-logged</div>
</div>

> Approval always goes **up** the hierarchy — a tier can only approve requests from a *strictly lower* tier. Timeout is set in `/settings → Behavior → Approval timeout`. Every action and approver is written to your audit-log channel.
